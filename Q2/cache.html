    <p>A browser's cache is a place on your hard drive. It keeps things that were
downloaded just in case they are needed again. When you visit a site for the
first time, the browser downloads several items into the cache and displays it
as part of the page you are viewing. If you visit a different page the browser
doesn't have to download it again since it's already there. When you clear your
cache data, the browser needs to re-download the data. So when you clear your
cache and refresh the website, the reason the MailChimp form displays again is
that it wasn't already downloaded to your hard drive. </p>
